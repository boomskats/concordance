# Lunar Frontiers
This Concordance sample illustrates a number of extremely powerful concepts. First and foremost, this sample is designed to allow developers to roll up their sleeves and play with **DDIL** (_Degraded, Disconnected, Intermittent, Limited Bandwidth_) networks. This is a very common scenario for many products, and we want to make sure that Concordance is a great platform for building applications that work in these environments.

It also serves as a good example of an application build on top of Concordance that is more complex than just a simple hello world. This example shows modeling digital twins of real-world objects, one way of dealing with the advancement of time to allow for this sample to be used as a simulator/game as well as a real-world application.

For more details on how to use this sample for **DDIL**, check out the [DDIL](./DDIL.md) document.
